### Projects

- **[minimal-emacs.d](https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d)**: The **minimal-emacs.d** project is a lightweight and optimized Emacs base (`init.el` and `early-init.el`) that **gives you full control over your configuration**. It provides better defaults, an optimized startup, and a clean foundation for building your own vanilla Emacs setup. In just a few minutes of applying what's in this README.md file, you will possess a fully functional, high-performance Emacs configuration ready for work. You will bypass hours of configuration and the heavy overhead of frameworks like Doom or Spacemacs, gaining immediate access to a foundation featuring optimized garbage collection, sensible UI defaults, and a fast startup. This is your fast track to a vanilla Emacs setup that remains lightweight, responsive, and entirely under your control. <img align="right" alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d?style=social">
